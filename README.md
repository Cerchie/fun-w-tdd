## About

This file was created to practice Test Driven Development with Virtual Coffee members. 

We were using TDD to create a function that takes in a Roman numeral, and returns an integer.

So far we have written tests and functionality to ensure that the parameter of our function is a Roman numeral, with this exception:

If the parameter is 'MCMXII', for example, it is valid and equal to 1512, but if it is 'IXI', it is not, because it is equal to 10, which can just be written as 'X'. 
This is where we left off. We are going to get back together at 6pm on Wedneday the 15th at 6pm GMT to compare solutions.

## Getting Started 

1. Run `git clone https://github.com/Cerchie/fun-w-tdd && cd fun-w-tdd`.

2. Run `npm install sinon`.

3. Run `nodemon index.js`.
